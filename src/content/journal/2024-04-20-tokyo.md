excerpt: "When the sun sets, Tokyo transforms. Neon reflections on rain-wet streets, ramen steam rising from basement restaurants — the city truly begins at night."

Tokyo is two cities. There is the daytime city — efficient, orderly, extraordinary in its own right. And then there is the city that emerges after sunset, when the neon signs blaze to life and the narrow alleys fill with steam and sound and the particular electricity of ten million people choosing exactly how to spend their evening.

I arrived in April, during cherry blossom season, when even the nights feel softened. The streets of Shinjuku were still dusted with petals.

## Shinjuku at Night

Start at Shinjuku station — the busiest in the world, a cathedral of movement — and let yourself be swept into the current of the crowd. Turn left out of the east exit and you enter Kabukicho, the entertainment district: bright, loud, alive in the way that only cities that never quite sleep can be.

Down the side streets, things quiet. Here you find the izakayas — Japanese pubs — where salarymen loosen their ties and order round after round of Sapporo and yakitori. Slide into a stool at the counter. Point at what others are eating. You will not be disappointed.

## Shibuya Crossing

No visit to Tokyo after dark is complete without standing at Shibuya Crossing — the famous scramble intersection where hundreds of pedestrians cross from every direction simultaneously when the lights change.

Stand on the upper floor of the Starbucks overlooking the crossing and watch for twenty minutes. It never gets old. There is something almost choreographic about it — five hundred strangers moving in perfect, improvised harmony.

## Ramen at Midnight

Tokyo's ramen shops operate on their own time. The best ones open late and close when the broth runs out. I found mine in a basement in Ebisu, at a counter with eight seats and a menu with four items.

The bowl arrived steaming. Tonkotsu broth, cloudy and rich, with perfectly soft-boiled eggs and slices of chashu pork that dissolved at a touch. I ate in silence. Everyone did. Some food demands reverence.

Tokyo at night is not a place you visit. It is a place you inhabit, briefly, before it lets you go.
